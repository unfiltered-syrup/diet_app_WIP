FLASK:
-- Add function in flask register route to check the following:
   	email follows the right format
	username does not contain swearing
	password contains at least one capital letters
	return error as string

-- Modify login route to return an error when email is not modified

-- Add support for email verification
	Create a column in user table called 'verified' (don't just modify sql.schema, make sure to update init_db.py as well)
	update 'verified' when user has finished email verification
	Email verification uses jwt from flask package 'flask_jwt_extended'


REACT:
-- Add responsive effect on buttons, show description on hover
-- Add top bar (?)
-- Update login and register page to display errors returned from FLASK


DATABASE:
-- Add python script (init_nutrition_database) to hold food nutrition data. (try to find dataset that already holds nutrition values of different ingrediants by weight and volume)
-- Add python script (init_recipe_database) to hold recipe data. Assign each recipe with unique id. (foreign key contraint!)
